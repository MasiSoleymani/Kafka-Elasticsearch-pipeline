# Kafkaâ€“Elasticsearch Pipeline with Kibana Visualization  

##  Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a **real-time data pipeline** using:  
- **Apache Kafka** for event streaming  
- **Elasticsearch** for indexing and search  
- **Kibana** for visualization  
- **Docker Compose** for orchestration  
- **Python** for producing and consuming events  

The system simulates **trade orders** (buy/sell stock events) that are streamed through Kafka, indexed into Elasticsearch, and visualized in Kibana.
